# Emory NLP

## Getting Started

* You must be invited to our [Slack](https://emorynlp.slack.com) workspace. We use Slack as the main source of communication so please accept the invitation. Upon the acceptance, please use your first name in lowercase and the last 2 digits of the invitation year as the **display name** (e.g., `jinho18`).  If you have a nickname that people are more familiar with (e.g., foreign students with American nicknames, "mike" instead of "michael"), feel free to use the nickname instead.
* Download the [Slack app](https://slack.com/downloads) on your desktop as well as your phone so you will get notified. It is important to check your Slack messages frequently; otherwise, we will quickly lose touch and the workflow becomes much slower. 
* Create a [Github](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one and send your Github ID to Jinho via Slack (`@jinho`). You will be invited to our Github organization, so please visit our [organization](https://github.com/emorynlp) and accept the invitation. We use Github as a central hub for all our repositories so please get familiar with [git](https://git-scm.com) (e.g., commit, push, pull, merge, branch).
* Learn how to write in [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org). You will be writing bi-weekly reports in LaTex as a practice to write real publications so please do not let the lack of your familiarity in LaTex be the bottleneck of publlishing your great ideas. [Texstudio](https://www.texstudio.org) has been found to be an useful LaTex editor, but feel free to use any other editor of your choice.
* Lab members only: please send your profile photo to Jinho; it will be posted to our [member page](http://http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu/members.html).
